# QuickPPOnline

Puyo like game made in Godot to be exported in HTML5 to be played online in your browser. Made entirely within gdscript.

Features:
- Be able to play Puyo in your browser in classic modes like endless and possibly tiny puyo
- Be able to do local and online 1v1s with other people easily with custom rulesets

Notes:
- 6x12 grid
- Basic competitive puyo mode
- Basic animations

Building:
This is made within Godot 4.1.x and to build simply load the project within godot and export using the web preset. Other future versions like 4.2 might break this project so I would not recommend to use any other version.

This uses the normal version of godot, not mono but it wouldnt cause issues if you were to use it.

Note:

Assets are property of Sega and if they require me to remove them or take this entire project down I would be willing to do so.
